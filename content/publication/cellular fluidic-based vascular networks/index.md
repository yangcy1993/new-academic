  Artificial organs are devices implanted into the living body as a substitute for damaged or diseased organs. Current efforts focus on the construction of fully functionalized artificial tissues/organs with vascular networks. Although engineering efforts have been made in creating artificial vessels with simple or complex configurations, building vascular networks with hierarchical architectures approximating native counterparts remains challenging. Herein, we give a perspective of cellular fluidics-based construction of vascular networks for tissue engineering, with inspirations drawn from a novel concept of 3D fluidic control platform based on unit-cell constructs. Through architected design of the unit cells, it enables programmed control over gas-liquid-solid interfaces and fluid flow processes in open-cell structures. This cellular-fluidics concept and the associated platform provide lots of inspirations for constructing artificial vascular networks. We believe that cellular fluidics opens a new avenue for fluid control and deterministic delivery, and would find vast opportunities in tissue engineering.
