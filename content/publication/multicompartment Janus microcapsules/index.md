  We propose a simple but efficient multiplex coaxial flow focusing (MCFF)
  process for single-step fabrication of multicompartment Janus microcapsules (MJMs) in a wide range of operating parameters. The produced MJMs consist of a multicompartmental coreâ€“shell structure with material compositions tunable in individual shell and core compartments. Potential applications of such a MJM agent are demonstrated in both benchtop and in vitro experiments. For the benchtop experiment, magnetic nanoparticles are loaded into one of the shell compartments and photopolymerized under ultraviolet light for controlled alignment and rotation of the microcapsules in a magnetic field. For the in vitro experiment, four different types of cells are encapsulated in the desired compartments of sodium alginate MJMs and co-cultured for seven days. By increasing the number of coaxial needles, we are also able to produce MJMs with three or more compartments. Our studies have shown that the proposed MCFF process is able to produce MJMs with desired material compositions and narrow size distribution. This process is inexpensive and scalable for mass production of various MJMs in its potential applications in biomedical imaging, drug delivery, and regenerative medicine
