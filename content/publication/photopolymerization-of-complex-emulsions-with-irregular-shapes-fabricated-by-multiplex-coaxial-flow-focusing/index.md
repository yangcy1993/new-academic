  We fabricate complex emulsions with irregular shapes in the microscale by a
  simple but effective

  multiplex coaxial flow focusing process. A multiphase cone-jet structure is steadily formed, and

  the compound liquid jet eventually breaks up into Janus microdroplets due to the perturbations

  propagating along the jet interfaces. The microdroplet shapes can be exclusively controlled by

  interfacial tensions of adjacent phases. Crescent-moon-shaped microparticles and microcapsules

  with designated structural characteristics are further produced under ultraviolet light of photopolymerization after removing one hemisphere of the Janus microdroplets. These complex emulsions

  have potential applications in bioscience, food, functional materials, and controlled drug delivery.
