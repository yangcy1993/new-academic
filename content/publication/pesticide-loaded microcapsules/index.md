  Microencapsulation of pesticide can reduce mammalian toxicity, phyto-toxicity, and protect the pesticides from rapid environmental degradation. The aim of this study was to develop a liquiddriven coaxial flow focusing (LDCFF) process for fabricating pesticide-loaded microcapsules having high encapsulation efficiency, loading efficiency and yield. We have optimized and evaluated the effects of process parameters on the size and morphology of pesticide-loaded microcapsules. The release of pesticides from pesticide-loaded microcapsules has sustained release profiles, which depends on their core-shell structure and shell material degradation process. LDCFF process enables successful encapsulation of pesticides in microcapsules with tunable characteristics important in pesticide applications.
