  External sinusoidal actuation is employed in the axisymmetric flow focusing (AFF) for generating uniform droplets in the jetting mode. The perturbations propagating along the meniscus surface can modulate the rupture of the liquid jet. Experiments indicate that the jet breakup length and the resultant droplet size can be precisely controlled in the synchronized regime, which are further confirmed by the scaling law. The finding of this study can help for better understanding of the underlying physics of actuation-aided AFF, and this active droplet generation method with fine robustness, high productivity, and nice process control would be advantageous for various potential applications.
