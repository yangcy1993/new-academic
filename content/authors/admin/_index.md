Chaoyu Yang is a postdoctor of University of Chinese Academy and Science. His research focuses on **microfluidics for novel material production**, fluid dynamics, nature-inspired engineering, droplet, wettability. Up to date, He has developed several strategies to create new functional materials using capillary microfluidic platforms. By dynamically manipulating the multiphase flow in the microchannel, new materials (such as jellyfish particles, double emulsions, spindle-knot microfibers, hemline microfibers, hemline microtube) are readily achieved. All the structures are based on the controlled flow configuration which can serve as templates to build new structures. Apart from the material production, he also developed **open microfluidic methods to scale up the fabrication of emulsion drops** to produce practical quantities. Which is motivated by both fundamental studies and the potential for creating technologically valuable materials, and some of the work has led to industrial applications.
